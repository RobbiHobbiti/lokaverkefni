To begin creating an RPG-style game, follow these steps:

1. **Plan the Game Design**:
  - Define the story, characters, and setting.
  - Decide on the gameplay mechanics (e.g., combat, exploration, inventory, leveling system).

2. **Choose a Framework**:
  - For Dart, consider using the Flame game engine, which is designed for 2D games.

3. **Set Up the Project**:
  - Ensure your Dart/Flutter environment is set up.
  - Add the necessary dependencies (e.g., `flame` package).

4. **Create the Game Structure**:
  - Design the main game loop.
  - Plan the game scenes (e.g., menu, battle, exploration).

5. **Implement Core Features**:
  - Character creation and stats.
  - Map and environment.
  - Combat system.
  - Inventory and items.

6. **Add Visuals and Audio**:
  - Create or source sprites, animations, and sound effects.

7. **Test and Iterate**:
  - Playtest frequently to refine mechanics and fix bugs.

8. **Polish and Optimize**:
  - Improve performance and add final touches.

Start small and expand as you progress.
